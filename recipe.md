Ingredients
2 tbsp olive oil
6 soft flour tortillas
175g red leicester cheese, grated
250g cooked chicken , chopped
2 medium tomatoes , sliced
For the adults
1 large ripe avocado
2 tsp lime or lemon juice
handful chopped coriander
4 tbsp soured cream

Method
STEP 1
Heat a non-stick frying pan over a medium heat, swirl 1 tableSpoon of the oil around, then add a tortilla. Sprinkle a handful of the cheese over one half of the tortilla, followed by some chicken and a few tomato slices. Season with a little salt and pepper. Cook for a few moments to melt the cheese, then fold over and cook until the tortilla is crisp.

STEP 2
Turn the tortilla out of the pan and cut into quarters. Repeat with another flour tortilla to make another child’s portion.

STEP 3
For the adults’ version, start by making a simple guacamole. Halve, stone, peel and slice the avocado, then mash it with the lime or lemon juice and a little seasoning.

STEP 4
Make the tortillas as before, adding a little chopped coriander. Serve two each and cut into halves rather than quarters. Serve with the guacamole and soured cream, scattered with a little more coriander.
